📦 No-Code Automation Platform
Automate workflows, streamline business processes, and build automation without writing a single line of code.

This platform empowers small businesses and non-technical users to create powerful, custom automation workflows for booking, invoicing, marketing campaigns, and more — all through a simple, drag-and-drop interface.

🚀 Project Overview
The No-Code Automation Platform allows users to build workflows visually using drag-and-drop components. These workflows can automate repetitive tasks like sending emails, scheduling appointments, generating invoices, and more.

With an easy-to-use interface and integration capabilities, this platform aims to help small businesses increase productivity, reduce human error, and save time.

✨ Key Features
Drag-and-Drop Workflow Builder: Design automation flows visually using triggers, actions, and conditions.
Customizable Triggers & Actions: Start workflows with specific triggers (like form submissions) and end them with actions (like sending emails).
Integrations: Connect to third-party services like email, SMS, and payment gateways (e.g., Stripe).
Role-Based Access Control: Grant specific permissions to users based on their role (Admin, Editor, Viewer, etc.).
Real-Time Notifications: Send email and SMS notifications when workflow actions are executed.
Analytics & Reports: View reports on workflow performance, execution times, and success rates.
Multi-Tenant Support: Multiple businesses can create their own workflows within a single system.
